# Common Data Structures ðŸ“š

Data structures are fundamental components of computer science and programming, providing a way to organize and store data efficiently. Here are some commonly used data structures:

## 1. Arrays:
   - **Description:** Arrays store elements of the same data type in contiguous memory locations.
   - **Example Usage:** Storing a list of integers `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

## 2. Linked Lists:
   - **Description:** Linked lists consist of nodes where each node contains data and a reference (pointer) to the next node.
   - **Example Usage:** Creating a dynamic list of elements where elements can be easily added or removed.

## 3. Stacks:
   - **Description:** Stacks follow the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are inserted and removed from the same end.
   - **Example Usage:** Implementing function call stack in programming languages, parentheses matching.

## 4. Queues:
   - **Description:** Queues follow the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle, where elements are inserted at the rear and removed from the front.
   - **Example Usage:** Implementing job scheduling algorithms, handling requests in web servers.

## 5. Trees:
   - **Description:** Trees are hierarchical data structures composed of nodes where each node has a parent-child relationship.
   - **Example Usage:** Representing hierarchical data like file systems, organizing data in databases.

## 6. Graphs:
   - **Description:** Graphs consist of vertices/nodes connected by edges/arcs, representing relationships between them.
   - **Example Usage:** Modeling social networks, routing algorithms in networks.

## 7. Hash Tables:
   - **Description:** Hash tables store key-value pairs, providing fast access to values based on keys.
   - **Example Usage:** Implementing dictionaries in programming languages, caching mechanisms.

## 8. Heaps:
   - **Description:** Heaps are binary trees that satisfy the heap property, where the parent node is greater than or equal to (max heap) or less than or equal to (min heap) its child nodes.
   - **Example Usage:** Implementing priority queues, heap sort algorithm.

## 9. Tries:
   - **Description:** Tries (Prefix Trees) are tree-based data structures used to store a dynamic set of strings.
   - **Example Usage:** Autocomplete features in text editors, spell checkers.

## 10. Sets:
   - **Description:** Sets are collections of unique elements with no particular order.
   - **Example Usage:** Removing duplicates from a list, checking for the presence of elements.

These data structures provide different ways to organize and manipulate data, each suitable for specific use cases and scenarios.
