# Structured Data Types ðŸ“Š

Structured data refers to information that is organized in a specific format, making it easy to search, analyze, and manipulate. It follows a predefined schema or model and is typically stored in databases or spreadsheets.

## Types of Structured Data:

1. **Tabular Data:**
   - Examples: Excel spreadsheets, CSV files, database tables.
   - Example Structure: Rows and columns, where each row represents a record and each column represents a field or attribute.

2. **Relational Data:**
   - Examples: SQL databases (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle).
   - Example Structure: Data is organized into tables, and relationships between tables are established using keys (e.g., primary keys, foreign keys).

3. **Hierarchical Data:**
   - Examples: XML (eXtensible Markup Language), JSON (JavaScript Object Notation).
   - Example Structure: Data is organized in a tree-like structure with parent-child relationships between elements.

4. **Graph Data:**
   - Examples: RDF (Resource Description Framework), Neo4j databases.
   - Example Structure: Data is represented as nodes and edges, where nodes represent entities, and edges represent relationships between entities.

## Characteristics of Structured Data:

1. **Consistency:**
   - Structured data follows a consistent format, making it easier to analyze and process.

2. **Queryability:**
   - Structured data can be queried using standard query languages like SQL, allowing for efficient retrieval of information.

3. **Scalability:**
   - Structured data systems are often scalable, enabling the storage and processing of large volumes of data.

4. **Interoperability:**
   - Structured data can be easily shared and integrated with other systems and applications.

## Tools and Technologies:

1. **Relational Database Management Systems (RDBMS):**
   - Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Microsoft SQL Server.
   - Use: Storing and querying structured data in tabular form.

2. **Data Modeling Tools:**
   - Examples: ERwin, Lucidchart, Microsoft Visio.
   - Use: Designing and visualizing the structure of relational databases.

3. **XML and JSON Parsers:**
   - Examples: lxml (Python library for XML proc
